> This is an academic project for I590: Data Visualization course at [Indiana University, Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu), Instructor: [Yong Yeol Ahn](http://yongyeol.com). Visualization is built by a team of 2: [myself](santhoshfiddle.com) and [Anusha Ramamurthy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anusharamamurthy). I am not gona talk much about the project ideation, view the [project page](http://www.santhoshfiddle.com/geoSample/index.html) for info on how we landed here in terms of design but defenitely we developed it keeping [The Flow of Refugee Towards Europe](http://www.lucify.com/the-flow-towards-europe/) in mind, tailored to our design needs.

### [Goal:]()

This is a step by step tutorial on creating transitions using tween functions on objects tied to a map/geo-location in D3.js. 

Everything is rendered in SVG!

A few weeks ago, I wrote a blog titled ["Interactive Maps with d3.js"](). Check that for how the map is generated with TopoJSON.
